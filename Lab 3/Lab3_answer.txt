##Submissions:
1.List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.

weblog aggregation query:
	SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS log_count
	FROM weblogs_schema GROUP BY user_id
	ORDER BY log_count DESC
	LIMIT 50;

1) Hive
Time taken: 52.134 seconds, Fetched: 50 row(s)

2) SparkSQL
Time taken: 9.133 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)

3) SparkSQL on Parquet
Time taken: 3.285 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)


2.How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?
Assuming this question is related to the weblog aggregation query in question 1.

1) Hive launches 2 jobs.

2) SparkSQL doesn't launch jobs.


3.Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.

spark-sql> select b.location, count(b.location) as loc_count 
		 > from weblogs_parquet as a join user_info as b on a.user_id=b.user_id 
		 > group by b.location 
		 > order by loc_count desc 
		 > limit 5;
