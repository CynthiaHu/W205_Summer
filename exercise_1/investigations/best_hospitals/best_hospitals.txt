Below is a list of top 10 hospitals of high-quality care. It's ranked first by final score in descending order and then score variability in ascending order.
It means that we want to find hospitals with high quality score but low score volatility.

To evaluate ovarall care quality of hospitals, I used two different types of measures: one type is related to timely and effective care
and another type is about readmission and death.
1) timely and effective care measures how quickly hospitals treat patients who come to the hospital with certain medical emergencies; 
	and how well hospitals provide preventive services. 
	The higher the score, the better.
2) readmission and death measures unplanned readmission to any acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from a hospitalization or
	estimates of deaths within 30-days of a hospital admission from any cause related to medical conditions. 
	The lower the rate, the better.
	
The final score of a hospital is equal to average effective score - average readmission score. Each average score is the average of multiple measures' score in that type.
As the sample size varies across measures and hospitals, especially some measures having very big sizes, simple average instead of weighted average is used.

Measures of effective care have different ranges which seems not typo error but reasonable scores for certain measures. Thus, all measures of effective care are scaled to
be in range [0, 100]. Readmission measures rates or score are already in [0, 100] range.

Hospital score variability is the standard deviation of all measure scores for this hospital.

In addition, below cleaning is applied before average and final score is calculated:
1. exclude score ='Not available' records.
2. exclude measureid = 'EDV' whose score shows Emergency department volume range, not a real score
3. exclude records of hospitals which don't have Emergency Services but have scores related to Emergency Department.
4. exclude records with invalid state names. 
5. exclude hospitals only having one measure with valid score
