I'm investigating whether average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability are correlated with patient survey responses.
There are 32 questions in the survey. Though there is no detailed document of all columns in the survey response dataset,
I think HCAHPSBaseScore is the aggregated score reflecting hospital quality and HCAHPSConsistencyScore is the aggregated score reflecting the response variability.
Thus, these two score fields are used in the correlation analysis.

As survey table is by hospital, I use hospital_final_score and survey table to calculate correlation coefficients between final_score, score_variability, BaseScore and ConsistencyScore.
Below is the result.

score_correlation       variability_correlation
-0.0111 				0.1684


We can see that the average score has slight low negative correlation with patient survey response (-1.1%)
but survey response variability does reflect the procedural variability as the correlation coefficient is almost 17%.
